            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am most fortunate for this life. I have been lucky to explore and develop many skills and interests in my life. During my undergraduate studies I was able to try-out and walk-on to the Women's Rowing Team. Before I knew it, I was coaching the university club team at my Graduate school, and then I realized this was not just a hobby.</p>
            <p>I followed this passion for the next five years, which took me from highschool rowing coach, to collegiate coach at multiple levels. I am most proud of the Division II National Championship I won during that time.</p>
            <p>Since then, I have noticed a growth in data analytics in the athletics industry. However, the rowing world has not quite caught up. Which is what initally sparked my interest in software development. Currently, rowing coaches everywhere are limited to Excel. Leaving many uniterested in diving more into the optimization of this sport.</p>
            <p>Thinkful is providing me with the skillset to develop everything from small websites, to coplex apps. Ultimately, I'm looking forward to developing that software that makes it simple, but engaging, for coaches everywhere to learn more about their athletes and their potential.</p>
